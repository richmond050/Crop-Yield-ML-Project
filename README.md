# Crop-Yield-ML-Project
This project focuses on predicting suitable crops based on key environmental factors like soil nutrients, temperature, humidity, pH levels, and rainfall. Using machine learning classification algorithms, we aim to assist farmers and agricultural experts in optimizing crop choices based on available data.
